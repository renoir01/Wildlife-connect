Description
WildlifeConnect is a web application designed to facilitate the connection between wildlife enthusiasts, researchers, and volunteers. It provides a platform for users to report wildlife sightings, book visits to parks, participate in community forums, and more.
Problem Statement
What is the problem?
Wildlife conservation efforts are often fragmented, with limited collaboration between volunteers, researchers, and tourists. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for meaningful contributions.
Why is it a problem?
- Lack of centralized reporting: Wildlife sightings and conservation reports are scattered across various platforms, making it difficult to aggregate data and identify trends.
- Inefficient communication: Stakeholders lack a unified platform to communicate and collaborate, leading to duplicated efforts and missed opportunities.
- Limited accessibility: Tourists and volunteers often struggle to find accurate information about park visits and conservation activities.
Proposed Solution
WildlifeConnect addresses these issues by providing:
- Centralized reporting: A unified platform for reporting wildlife sightings and conservation activities.
- Collaborative environment: Forums and community features to facilitate communication and collaboration between stakeholders.
- Accessible information: Easy-to-navigate booking systems and information about parks and events.
